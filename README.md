# 30-Day AIDD Challenge

This repository contains my **30-day journey** of learning and building with **AI‑Driven Development (AIDD)**. Throughout this challenge, I use tools like **Gemini CLI** and **Speckit Plus** to explore how AI can support and accelerate software development.

## 📚 What’s Inside

- `day-1/`, `day-2/`, … `day-30/`  
  Each folder holds the task, reflections, code, and other resources for that day.  
- Core tools:  
  - **Gemini CLI** – for AI-assisted coding, generation, and evaluation  
  - **Speckit Plus** – for prompt-driven AI workflows  

---

## 🚀 Why This Challenge Exists

- To understand how developers and AI can collaborate on real projects  
- To improve productivity and creativity using AI agents  
- To document my personal learning journey — from simple scripts to full-stack development  
- To build a reference repository for AI‑augmented development techniques

## 🔧 How to Use This Repo

1. Pick a day folder (e.g., `day-1/`).  
2. Open the `task.md` to read the task and view my reflections.  
3. Explore any code or assets in that folder.  
4. Repeat for other days to track progress.

## 📝 My Learning Journey (2022–Present)

- Started coding in **2022** (Turbo C++, VS Code)  
- Learned by debugging C, watching YouTube tutorials, and writing Arduino code  
- Used **ChatGPT** early on after it launched  
- Won an **IoT Arduino competition** (Sindh region)  
- Built frontend and backend code manually (MERN stack, Fastapi) , Ai agents along with tons of frontned and backend tools.   
- Currently using **Gemini CLI** + **Speckit Plus** to drive AI-assisted development
